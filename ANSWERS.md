Self-Study/Essay Questions

1) What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript.

    'PropTypes' is a built-in method of React that allows us to validate the properties that are being passed into a component. It is very important to type check our data in JS because JS is such a dynamic language that it EXPECTS us, as developers, to know what we're doing, so JS, itself, does NOT have built-in type-checking functionality. With programming, it is very easy to accidentally end up receiving a different data type in your output data [from a function or a higher order component] than what you EXPECTED, especially when manipulating large amounts of data.

2) Describe a life-cycle event in React?



3) Explain the details of a Higher Order Component?



4) What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each.
